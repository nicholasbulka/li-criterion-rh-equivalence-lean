Zeros with multiplicity for Hadamard factorization.

This complements `HadamardFactorization.ZeroSet` (which only records an enumeration of distinct
zeros) by also recording a multiplicity for each zero. The primary use is to define a canonical
product where each Weierstrass factor occurs with the appropriate multiplicity.

# Zero sets with multiplicity

`ZeroSetMultiplicity` refines `ZeroSet` with a multiplicity function, and re-indexes the zeros
as a sigma type so that the factorization theorem applies without assuming simple zeros.
